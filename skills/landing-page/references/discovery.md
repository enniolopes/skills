# Discovery, Desk Research, and Reference Study

Load this reference for CREATE, major REFINE, weak/underspecified briefs, public desk research, competitive/category study, or visual/reference research.

The purpose of research is **not** to make the user act as creative director. Research exists to reduce avoidable uncertainty, widen the creative search space, and give the agent enough evidence to make better decisions autonomously.

## Decision order

Always prefer:

`discover → infer safely → choose as expert → ask only if blocking`

A good run should usually reduce the number of questions the user has to answer.

## Decision authority

Use one ownership basis rather than memorizing case lists:

- **Professional + reversible** → the agent decides. This includes design, narrative form, typography, palette, imagery, motion, responsive composition, visual signature and implementation when no external authority owns the choice.
- **Factual / authoritative / committed** → evidence or the owning authority decides. This includes product capability, pricing/terms, legal/security/compliance claims, customer proof, quantitative outcomes, business commitments and explicitly governed brand/positioning departures.

A creative choice may have factual implications; those implications still belong to the second axis. Never turn missing business truth into invented creative confidence.

When authority is blocking, ask in consequences rather than design jargon.

Bad: `Do you prefer an editorial or cinematic direction?`

Better: `The current product is sold through enterprise demos, while the new campaign brief points toward self-serve trial. I can optimize the page for one primary action; I recommend enterprise demo because that is the current live sales path. Should this campaign instead prioritize trial?`

## Research value and stopping rule

Research only while the expected information can materially change a decision. Typical decision classes include proposition, audience/arrival model, proof, category grammar, distinction opportunity, creative direction and implementation feasibility.

Stop a lane when more information is unlikely to change the decision it was opened to resolve. Do not research because research is available, and do not keep collecting references after the page is sufficiently grounded merely to appear thorough.

### CREATE

Default to meaningful discovery unless the user has already supplied a strong, evidence-rich brief and reference set.

### REFINE

Diagnose first. Research only the layers limiting quality. If the problem is generic category positioning, study category/visual saturation. If the problem is local craft, do not reopen market research.

### REPAIR

Usually no external research. Stay local unless the defect depends on an external technical fact.

## Source hierarchy

For factual/product truth, prefer:

1. user-supplied/canonical product documentation;
2. live first-party product/site/pricing/docs;
3. repository/product behavior;
4. trustworthy primary external sources;
5. secondary reporting;
6. community/review evidence as anecdotal context only.

For visual/creative research, provenance matters less than understanding what is being learned. Never copy protected artwork or another site's identity; extract abstract properties and create an original composition.

## Internal evidence

Before any external lane, inspect what is already available:

- product/site/application and its real UI;
- repository, framework, design primitives, tokens, fonts, assets, routing and patterns;
- docs, pricing, changelog, demos and screenshots;
- brand assets, copy and prior campaigns;
- supplied customer evidence and claims;
- existing analytics/research present in the working context.

## Desk research lanes

Use only the lanes that answer material questions.

### 1. Product truth

Find:

- what the product actually does;
- core mechanism/workflow;
- target user/buyer;
- offer and conversion path;
- strongest real product evidence;
- constraints/limitations relevant to copy;
- brand language and product vernacular.

Useful sources include docs, product UI, pricing, changelog, help center, demos, launch material and repository assets.

### 2. Audience/context

Infer or research:

- sophistication level;
- likely arrival intent;
- language used to describe the problem;
- risk/objection profile;
- how quickly they need to understand the offer;
- device/context when material.

Avoid manufacturing a detailed persona from weak evidence. Use the smallest audience model that changes design decisions.

### 3. Category grammar

Study direct alternatives to answer:

- what conventions help visitors orient quickly;
- what information/proof categories are expected;
- what vocabulary is stable enough to use;
- where competitors create friction or ambiguity.

A convention is not automatically a cliché. Preserve useful interaction/content grammar when it reduces cognitive cost.

### 4. Saturation / anti-reference

Identify patterns that have become generic in the category:

- repeated compositions;
- repeated visual metaphors;
- repeated claims/taglines;
- repeated color/type tropes;
- gratuitous interaction patterns;
- proof devices everyone uses without differentiation.

Record these as **anti-references** when avoiding them creates useful whitespace.

Do not reject a saturated pattern if it remains the clearest solution. Distinction is not novelty for its own sake.

### 5. Proof norms

Find what makes claims believable in this category:

- product demonstration;
- case evidence;
- technical detail;
- before/after state;
- quantified outcome;
- certification/standard;
- customer/peer proof;
- transparent mechanism.

Use only evidence actually available to the project. Research can tell you what proof would be valuable; it cannot fabricate it.

### 6. Technical precedent

For unusual interactions, 3D, WebGL, scroll narrative, audio, video, device inputs, or performance-sensitive work, research implementation precedent only when uncertainty is real.

Seek:

- browser/capability support;
- performance traps;
- accessibility implications;
- fallback strategies;
- simpler mechanisms that may deliver the same experience.

## Reference study: build a visual world, not a collage

A reference study should lead to a design thesis, not a shopping list of websites.

### Pool A — adjacent/category

Use direct competitors/peers mainly to map:

- familiar grammar;
- saturation;
- expected proof;
- what not to imitate.

Do not derive the signature primarily from adjacent references; that tends to pull toward the category mean.

### Pool B — peer-class digital craft

Use high-quality digital references to study transferable properties such as:

- full-page rhythm;
- composition;
- typographic hierarchy;
- image/product integration;
- motion choreography;
- interaction feedback;
- technical restraint/ambition;
- responsive transformation.

### Pool C — non-adjacent world

Prefer this pool when distinction matters. Search the subject's own world and neighboring disciplines:

- editorial/print;
- architecture/interiors;
- industrial/product design;
- film titles/cinematography;
- photography;
- packaging;
- scientific/technical visualization;
- maps/signage;
- fashion/textile;
- physical materials;
- instruments/control surfaces;
- historical/domain artifacts.

This pool should help the page feel culturally and materially specific rather than like a remix of current web galleries.

## Reference extraction protocol

For every reference worth keeping, record mentally or explicitly:

- `SOURCE` — what the reference is;
- `EXTRACT` — the abstract property worth learning from;
- `RELEVANCE` — why that property serves this brief;
- `REJECT` — what must not be copied/carried over;
- `ROLE` — convention, inspiration, technical precedent, or anti-reference.

Example:

```text
SOURCE: scientific imaging console
EXTRACT: dense annotation around one high-contrast primary field
RELEVANCE: makes complex evidence feel inspectable and controlled
REJECT: literal medical palette and faux instrumentation
ROLE: non-adjacent inspiration
```

Do not write `make it look like [reference]` as the design strategy.

## Moodboard / visual-world synthesis

If image search, screenshots, a design canvas, or image generation is available, it can be useful to externalize the visual world. The artifact is optional; the synthesis is mandatory.

A useful visual-world synthesis contains enough information to guide relevant media without freezing them: emotional anchors; material/texture vocabulary; typography character; composition/density principles; imagery/crop/lighting behavior; color relationships; motion/interaction character when relevant; domain-specific motifs; anti-references; and signature territory worth exploring.

Do not let a moodboard become a contract to copy. Its job is to establish a **world of possibilities**.

## Preserve independent ideation

References can create anchoring. For high-ambition work, do at least one of these before committing:

- form an initial thesis from the product/domain before studying peer designs;
- include non-adjacent references;
- generate at least one concept whose governing idea does not come from a reference site;
- explicitly list what the category does repeatedly and design away from it when appropriate.

The test is not whether the work is unprecedented. It is whether the solution was **derived**, not merely adopted.

## Synthesis object

`marketing.md` owns the canonical page-intent basis. Discovery fills that same basis rather than inventing a parallel brief schema:

```yaml
page_intent:
  page_job:
  audience:
  arrival_context:
  offer:
  proposition:
  proof_and_friction:
  action:

market:
  conventions_to_preserve:
  cliches_to_avoid:
  proof_norms:
  differentiation_space:

creative:
  emotional_target:
  visual_world:
  signature_territory:
  technical_opportunity:

constraints:
  brand:
  implementation:
  truth_or_authority_gaps:
```

This is an internal decision object, not a mandatory user-facing document. Populate only what changes decisions; do not turn optional fields into ceremony.

## Evidence status

For any **truth-bearing** item, use exactly one epistemic status:

- `KNOWN` — supported by user input or inspected evidence;
- `INFERRED` — reasonable, reversible interpretation that creates no false fact;
- `UNKNOWN` — not established and must not be represented as fact.

Creative choices are not a fourth evidence status. They are professional decisions on a separate axis and may be explored freely; any factual implication they introduce must still be `KNOWN`, safely `INFERRED`, or remain `UNKNOWN`.

Resolve discoverable facts, safe reversible inferences and professional creative decisions yourself. Only an `UNKNOWN` that blocks truth, authority, or a material irreversible fork may become a question. If a reversible default exists, take it and continue.

## Question protocol

After discovery/synthesis, ask only if all are true:

1. the answer is not reasonably discoverable;
2. a safe reversible assumption is not available;
3. the answer materially changes truth, authority, commercial outcome, or brand position;
4. proceeding would create avoidable rework or a misleading result.

If asking:

- batch questions;
- use plain language;
- state what you found;
- give a recommendation/default;
- ask for the minimum decision.

Never ask a non-expert to solve the design problem you were engaged to solve.
