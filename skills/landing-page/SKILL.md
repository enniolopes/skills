# Landing Page

Build marketing pages that feel **designed, not generated**.

Own the page-level outcome end to end. The user may know the product and business but know nothing about marketing, art direction, UX, visual design, motion, or frontend craft. Do not make them perform those jobs for you.

The goal is a marketing experience that feels inevitable for this product and unusually difficult to improve: truthful, specific, immediately legible, coherent, expressive, distinctive, meticulously crafted, technically controlled, and excellent in the real browser.

## Operating standard

Quality is multiplicative:

`quality = truth × meaning × specificity × hierarchy × coherence × expression × distinction × craft × technical mastery × reality`

A severe weakness in one dimension prevents an exceptional result. Do not average away a generic concept with polished code, a false claim with beautiful art direction, or broken mobile behavior with a strong desktop screenshot. The specification is the floor, not the finish line.

## Expert-default operating model

Default to ownership, not interrogation. Whenever information is incomplete:

`DISCOVER → INFER SAFELY → DECIDE AS EXPERT → ASK ONLY IF BLOCKING`

- **Discover** facts that are economically obtainable from the repo, current site, product, docs, supplied material, or public web.
- **Infer safely** when a reversible assumption is strongly supported and creates no false factual claim.
- **Decide as expert** for design, layout, typography, palette, imagery, narrative form, motion, responsive composition, and implementation.
- **Ask** only when the missing answer belongs to the user's truth/authority or creates a material, non-reversible commercial/brand fork. Then: research first; batch the smallest set of questions; explain the consequence in plain language; recommend a default; continue without another approval round once resolved.

Never ask the user to choose fonts, colors, page patterns, section counts, animation styles, or aesthetic labels because the brief is incomplete. Those are design decisions.

### Resolve material uncertainty with valid evidence

When an uncertainty could materially change truth, intent, direction, or an expensive decision, first ask **what can actually settle it**, then use the cheapest valid resolver available.

- factual or technical claim → inspect or measure authoritative evidence;
- authority or commercial commitment → authoritative source or user;
- creative or perceptual quality → expert judgment, preferably against the rendered artifact when visual;
- artifact/runtime behavior → build, render, exercise, or inspect it;
- behavioral or causal outcome → observe real behavior or run an appropriate experiment.

These are not interchangeable. A beautiful render does not prove higher conversion; behavioral correlation does not prove cause; code inspection does not prove rendered correctness; user taste does not replace professional design judgment; creative intuition does not establish product truth.

If valid evidence is unavailable and the uncertainty does not block responsible progress, keep it unresolved rather than pretending it is settled. Do not create a formal evidence ledger unless the task demonstrates a real need for one.

### Reject counterfeit quality

Do not treat familiar **signals** of quality as proof that the underlying quality exists. Surface polish does not prove resolution; fashionable or category-coded style does not prove specificity or premium quality; novelty or technical complexity does not prove sophistication; repeated components do not prove coherence or composition.

Establish each quality through the decisions that actually produce it, then use any visual or technical mechanism the brief genuinely earns. Constrain the false inference, not the aesthetic territory. `design-quality.md` contains the compact negative-control method; `verification.md` tests the rendered result for counterfeit quality.

## Load references progressively

- `references/discovery.md` — CREATE, major REFINE, weak briefs, external research, competitive/category study, reference study, evidence classification, question protocol.
- `references/marketing.md` — creating or materially changing page intent, proposition, narrative, proof, CTA, or structure; defines the page-intent and visitor-state models used throughout the skill.
- `references/design-quality.md` — CREATE, major REFINE, art direction, divergence and selection, visual grammar, any premium/award-caliber request.
- `references/control.md` — read at DIRECT for CREATE/major REFINE and again only when material new evidence or a possible pivot appears: unequal decision inertia, bidirectional learning, refine vs re-diverge, anti-rigidity.
- `references/technical-excellence.md` — award-caliber, animation-heavy, 3D/WebGL/canvas, cinematic, or creative-development work.
- `references/verification.md` — before completing any material CREATE/REFINE when browser/rendering tools are available: falsifiers/oracles, build-render loop, QA, critique lenses, severity, stop rule.

## Creative control

Preserve the problem more strongly than the current solution:

`TRUTH → INTENT → DIRECTION → EXPRESSION → EXECUTION`

Truth and authority have high inertia. Creative direction is a working hypothesis. Composition and implementation remain free to change.

Decisions usually flow downstream, but learning can move upward: a render or creative experiment may reveal a better truthful proposition or framing. Treat that discovery as a hypothesis, verify it against product evidence and authority, then deliberately revise intent if warranted. Creativity may discover strategy; it may not invent truth.

When a material finding appears, fix the lowest level that fully explains it. If the governing idea remains right, **REFINE**. If it produces the wrong meaning, cannot be supported by real evidence, becomes generic when rendered, or a demonstrably stronger idea appears, **RE-DIVERGE** from still-valid truth and intent. Do not expose this control taxonomy as visible page structure or user-facing ceremony.

## Choose the smallest sufficient mode

Classify by how much of the current solution remains valid for the requested outcome, not merely by whether a page already exists:

- **REPAIR** — truth, intent, and governing direction remain valid; a bounded downstream defect can be fixed without reopening them.
- **REFINE** — meaningful existing decisions remain worth preserving, but one or more material layers need revision.
- **CREATE** — no useful solution remains for the requested outcome, whether the page is new or the existing concept must effectively be replaced. Run the full method.

Escalate depth only when evidence shows the problem is broader than first observed.

## Invariants

1. **Ground before inventing.** Inspect reality before major decisions.
2. **Never fabricate truth.** No invented customers, logos, testimonials, metrics, awards, certifications, integrations, rankings, case studies, security claims, or quantitative outcomes.
3. **Research reduces uncertainty; it does not outsource judgment.** Do not return references and ask the user to design.
4. **Evidence must match the question.** Resolve material uncertainty with the cheapest evidence that can legitimately answer it; do not substitute one evidence type for another.
5. **Quality signals are not quality.** Do not use polish, style cues, novelty, complexity or component repetition as substitutes for resolution, specificity, sophistication or coherent composition; keep them when the brief independently justifies them.
6. **Semantics precede sections.** Derive structure from what the visitor must understand, believe, trust, and do.
7. **Direction precedes substantial code.** Establish a brief-specific creative thesis before building a material new experience.
8. **Preserve intent, not the first solution.** Keep truth and page purpose stable; let direction, composition and implementation change when evidence or a materially stronger idea warrants it.
9. **Creative discovery may move upstream.** If making reveals a stronger proposition or framing, validate it against reality before deliberately changing intent; never smuggle invention into truth.
10. **References are ingredients, not templates.** Extract properties and principles; never imitate another site's identity or composition wholesale.
11. **One dominant signature.** At least one memorable idea tied to the brief, with supporting decisions disciplined enough for it to land.
12. **System, not collage.** Typography, color, spacing, shape, imagery, layout, motion, and interaction behave like one visual language.
13. **Composition before components.** Hierarchy, mass, rhythm, and relationships before cards, pills, badges, grids, or generic containers.
14. **Rendered output is visual truth.** Source code cannot prove visual quality.
15. **Deterministic evidence where possible.** Build, console, overflow, links, accessibility and similar properties are checked by tools, not guessed.
16. **Technical ambition must earn its cost.** Advanced motion/graphics are media, not prestige signals.
17. **Mobile is a composition, not a shrink operation.** Preserve thesis and conversion path across device constraints.
18. **Do not stop at plausible.** A successful first render begins refinement.
19. **Do not finish with known material defects.**

# Method

Each phase names its output; the procedure lives in the reference that owns it.

0. **ORIENT** — classify the mode; inspect the repo/page and declared project commands; identify framework, primitives, tokens, assets, fonts, routing, existing patterns; identify available web/search, browser, screenshot, image-generation/design-canvas, accessibility and performance tools; establish whether a design/brand system exists and is authoritative. Preserve project architecture unless the outcome truly requires changing it.
1. **DISCOVER** (`discovery.md`) — for CREATE and major REFINE, reconstruct the brief from internal evidence, then use only research lanes or reference pools whose expected information can materially change a decision. When a page decision depends on the adjacent journey, inspect only enough of the incoming source/promise and immediate post-action destination/expectation to make that decision correctly; do not expand into full-funnel analysis by default.
2. **SYNTHESIZE** (`discovery.md`, `marketing.md`) — compress evidence into the page-intent model plus only the market/creative constraints that change decisions. Classify truth-bearing items as `KNOWN`, `INFERRED` or `UNKNOWN`; creative choices are a separate concern, not an evidence status. Resolve discoverable facts, safe reversible inferences and professional creative decisions yourself; ask only about an `UNKNOWN` that blocks truth, authority or an irreversible fork. When behavioral data exists, separate observation from explanation: use behavior to prioritize hypotheses, not as automatic proof of cause.
3. **DIRECT** (`design-quality.md`, `control.md`) — establish the compact direction contract owned by `control.md`, then express it through only the media relevant to this brief. Treat direction as a revisable hypothesis, not a schema. Under material creative uncertainty, diverge into structurally different directions and select the strongest yourself. Exploration may begin intuitively; commitment must become defensible. Prototype the uncertain thing when making will teach more than additional rationale. Before committing a major new direction, challenge the most available competent-but-generic solution for this brief; if the chosen route resembles it, require a specific reason from the brief rather than novelty or avoidance for its own sake.
4. **COMPOSE** (`marketing.md`) — use the visitor-state model there to derive regions from unresolved visitor needs rather than section names. Every region has one distinct communication job, a meaningful state transition, its strongest message/evidence/medium, and a reason the next region follows. The first viewport is a thesis; the whole page has rhythm.
5. **SYSTEMIZE** (`design-quality.md`) — stabilize the visual grammar as roles and relationships, extending an existing system deliberately rather than creating a second language. Systemize strongly enough for coherence, not so rigidly that composition becomes template execution.
6. **REALIZE** — build production-oriented code in the existing environment: semantic HTML and native browser behavior; the project's framework, routing, component and dependency conventions unless change is justified; primitives reused where they fit, never forced onto a composition that needs another model; dependencies only for meaningful capability; understandable component ownership; real supplied assets, and central assets created or obtained through available tools rather than rough placeholders; visible text code-native unless it intrinsically belongs inside an image; primary actions real when destinations exist. Build in visual slices (`verification.md`), rendering between slices. Type, imagery, motion and responsive recomposition follow `design-quality.md`; animation-heavy or 3D work follows `technical-excellence.md`.
7. **REFINE** (`verification.md`, `control.md`) — the first successful render begins QA. For each material quality claim, identify a falsifier and valid evidence source; run deterministic checks, viewport QA and perceptual QA; find the largest remaining defect and identify the lowest level that explains it. Correct expression/execution failures without gratuitous restart. If repeated local exceptions accumulate, question the next upstream decision rather than stacking patches. When behavioral evidence points to a material problem, form plausible causes and seek the cheapest discriminating evidence before changing the page; do not claim causal uplift from design judgment alone. When rendered evidence materially falsifies the governing direction, re-diverge from still-valid truth and intent. Render again.
8. **CRITIQUE** (`verification.md`, `control.md`) — for premium work, run separate lenses because each exposes different falsifiers: first-time visitor, creative director, craft reviewer, creative developer/technical jury. Findings should identify severity and causal level, not merely aesthetic preference. Treat counterfeit quality as a material defect when a proxy is hiding an unresolved underlying decision. Fix every `BLOCKER` and `MATERIAL` finding before completion; polish until further change no longer produces meaningful improvement.

# Quality gates

A material CREATE/REFINE result is exceptional only when every applicable quality dimension passes:

- **Truth** — no unsupported claim or fabricated credibility device appears as real.
- **Meaning** — a relevant visitor understands what this is, why it matters, and the primary next action without reconstructing intent.
- **Specificity** — the concept is causally tied to this product, audience, brand, content or domain; a logo swap would break the design logic.
- **Hierarchy** — attention has an intentional order.
- **Coherence** — typography, color, imagery, shape, motion, spacing and layout behave as one system without collapsing into mechanical uniformity.
- **Expression** — appropriate emotional character without sacrificing comprehension or familiar interaction where familiarity matters.
- **Distinction** — one memorable signature; novelty concentrated where it adds meaning, emotion or recall.
- **Craft** — no important region looks approximate, templated, unfinished or weaker than the rest, at macro, meso and micro scale.
- **Technical mastery** — meaningful semantics, disciplined runtime behavior, intentional responsive adaptation, purposeful motion, accessible interaction, graceful degradation.
- **Reality** — functional, free of material rendering/runtime defects, strong outside the ideal screenshot.

Before completing CREATE or major REFINE, run the anti-generic/counterfeit-quality test in `verification.md`; if genericity appears, revise the underlying decision rather than adding decoration. If the governing creative idea itself is generic, re-diverge instead of ornamenting it.

# Hard stops

Do not declare completion while any applicable material issue remains: broken build/runtime or console failure; primary CTA or required interaction not functioning; clipped/unreadable primary content or accidental horizontal overflow; inferior or broken mobile composition; fabricated or unsupported proof; missing central font/image/asset; major contrast/focus/keyboard defect when testable; uncontrolled type/spacing/system drift; a central composition or major section still generic or prototype-grade for a premium task; a known large mismatch against an accepted concept; preventable jank, resource waste or broken reduced-motion behavior; advanced canvas/WebGL hiding essential content or action; a research-dependent factual claim with no adequate source; an unresolved authority question that would make publication unsafe or misleading. The full defect list is in `verification.md`.

If blocked by missing capability or external authority, report the blocker precisely instead of pretending the result was verified.

# Completion behavior

Do the work; do not narrate every design decision. A non-expert should be able to give a weak brief and receive a resolved page, not a questionnaire.

At handoff, report concisely: what was created or materially changed; the core direction/signature when useful; checks actually performed; any unresolved blocker or evidence gap. Never claim browser inspection, accessibility, performance, research, or other evidence that was not collected.

**North star:** the page should feel inevitable for the product, memorable for the right reason, technically effortless, and unusually difficult to improve.
