# Branding Studio

Create and operate brand systems with professional autonomy. Inspect reality before asking, protect truth and earned equity, explore before committing, judge creative work as creative work, test systems in use, and never turn a proxy for quality into proof of quality.

The target is a brand that is **truthful, relevant, specific, distinctive, coherent, generative, flexible, crafted, real and durable**. A structurally complete spec, polished mockup or persuasive rationale is not evidence that this target has been reached.

## Operating workflow

Run creation and material change through:

**GROUND → FRAME → DIVERGE → COMMIT DIRECTION → BUILD SYSTEM → TEST IN USE → REFINE OR RE-DIVERGE → PACKAGE**

### GROUND
Inspect the strongest available sources before asking the user to restate them: current brand state, native/source assets, product/site/repository, business material, existing equity, declared touchpoints, category/competitor context and current external facts when they matter.

Research only while it can materially change a decision. Stop when additional information is unlikely to change one, or when the next uncertainty requires unavailable authority or external reality.

### FRAME
Define the brand problem before designing the answer. Establish only what materially governs the work:
- **brand job** — what business/organizational transition the brand must help produce;
- audience and relevant stakeholders;
- offer/product/service truth;
- alternatives/category context;
- position / desired meaning;
- right to win or credible basis;
- existing equity and constraints that should survive.

Do not manufacture a manifesto, archetype, onliness statement, category-entry-point model or other framework merely because one exists.

### DIVERGE
Explore materially different strategic or creative lineages, not cosmetic variants. Exploration may be intuitive; commitment must become defensible.

Before converging, identify the most available competent-but-generic solution to this brief. If a route resembles it, ask what in this specific brand actually earns that choice. Do not mechanically invert the default.

### COMMIT DIRECTION
Choose a governing creative thesis only when it has enough strategic fit, specificity and generative potential to deserve continuation. A direction remains a working hypothesis until use demonstrates that it can generate a system.

Converge and recommend. Do not outsource routine professional judgment through an unranked menu.

### BUILD SYSTEM
Translate the direction into the smallest verbal/visual grammar that can generate new work without copying old layouts. Define only dimensions that matter to declared touchpoints.

A useful system creates recognizable family resemblance while allowing meaningful variation. Repetition alone is not coherence.

### TEST IN USE
Use representative applications that expose materially different stresses. Make/render/inspect the work in realistic context whenever the environment permits it.

One-off failure stays local. Repeated failures across legitimate applications indicate a guidance or system problem. A weak governing idea, recurring genericity or failure to generate coherent range is a reason to re-open direction rather than polish harder.

### REFINE OR RE-DIVERGE
Fix the lowest layer that explains the defect.
- execution/craft defect → refine execution;
- local application defect → fix the artifact;
- recurring grammar defect → repair the system;
- governing idea no longer explains or generates the work → re-diverge;
- strategy/brand job invalidated → re-frame.

Creative judgment and artifact evidence may legitimately change creative/system decisions. Claims about actual perception, recall, behavior, preference, fame or legal status still require appropriate external evidence.

### PACKAGE
Persist only durable operating decisions and deliver only the artifacts the mission needs. Guidelines and brand books are designed teaching artifacts, not dumps of canonical state.

## Resolve uncertainty with the right evidence

Use the cheapest evidence capable of settling the material question:

| Question | Legitimate resolver |
|---|---|
| inspectable/current fact | source inspection or current authoritative evidence |
| private/future/organizational truth | owning source or user authority |
| creative/perceptual quality | professional judgment against explicit criteria |
| artifact/system performance | make, render, inspect, measure or trial in context |
| market perception/behavior | real audience/stakeholder/behavioral evidence |
| consequential legal claim | current authoritative sources and qualified specialist when stakes require it |

Evidence of one type cannot be coerced into proof of another. Model agreement is not market validation; desk research is not measured perception; structural validity is not strategic or aesthetic quality; trademark triage is not legal clearance.

## Human gates

Do not use the user as a substitute for inspection or professional judgment. Interrupt only when a missing **truth**, legitimate **authority** or unavailable **external reality** can materially change the decision.

Routine reversible choices such as type treatment, palette behavior, composition or route mechanics belong to the agent when strategy and evidence are sufficient. As consequence, irreversibility and equity at risk increase, raise the evidence and authority bar.

## Quality control

Judge important work against the same properties:
- **Truth** — no invented business or market reality.
- **Relevance** — decisions solve the actual brand job.
- **Specificity** — choices depend causally on this brand, not only its category.
- **Distinction** — difference is perceptible without becoming arbitrary.
- **Coherence** — verbal, visual and behavioral expression share one logic.
- **Generativity** — the system can produce new work instead of a fixed template.
- **Flexibility** — expression can vary without losing identity.
- **Craft** — individual elements survive close professional inspection.
- **Reality** — the system survives actual touchpoints, production and constraints.
- **Durability** — the solution is not merely a fashionable quality signal.

Reject counterfeit quality:
- spec completeness is not brand resolution;
- symbolism is not meaning;
- style signals are not specificity, distinctiveness, premium quality or timelessness;
- repetition is not coherence or recognizability;
- mockup polish is not system performance;
- research volume is not insight.

A familiar mechanism remains valid when the brief independently earns it. Constrain the false inference, not the aesthetic territory.

## Route by requested outcome

| Situation | Route | Load |
|---|---|---|
| create a new brand, reconstruct an undocumented identity, or materially re-found one | **CREATE** | `references/create.md` |
| current brand contract exists; make a new touchpoint | **APPLY** | `references/apply.md` |
| evaluate an existing artifact/system | **AUDIT** | `references/audit.md` |
| current contract may need material change | **EVOLVE** | `references/evolve.md` |

For an existing identity with no spec, reconstruct what is already true and valuable before changing it. Absence of a spec is not evidence that the brand needs redesign.

Load `references/creative-direction.md` only when creating or materially reopening expression; `references/identity-craft.md` for visual identity/system craft; `references/verbal-identity.md` when proposition, messaging, voice/tone or a broader verbal identity is in scope; `references/naming.md` when naming is in scope; `references/brand-book.md` when guidelines or a brand book are deliverables; `references/knowledge.md` when evidence strength/current facts/methodology need calibration; and `references/spec-schema.md` when canonical state is created or changed.

For APPLY/AUDIT, compile the smallest relevant subset of state.

## Canonical state

`brand-spec.json` is a sparse durable operating contract shaped by `templates/brand-spec.template.json`. Persist a decision only when its absence would materially increase future drift.

Do not persist internal exploration, rejected routes, routine trials, generic research notes, prompts or ceremonial fields. Omit irrelevant blocks instead of filling them with `not_applicable`, empty framework outputs or speculative detail.

Version meaningful contract changes. Preserve evidence references only when future work needs them to understand a consequential decision or unresolved reality dependency.

## Production and deterministic tools

Tool availability is not production proof. Degrade claims honestly:

`final master → tested prototype → concept → recommendation`

Use deterministic tools only for properties code can establish:
- `scripts/validate_structure.py spec.json` — schema/types/enums/references and other machine-checkable constraints;
- `scripts/color_tools.py ...` — exact color/contrast calculations;
- `scripts/asset_checks.py logo.svg` — deterministic SVG production checks;
- `scripts/portfolio_collision.py portfolio.json spec.json` — advisory comparison signals only, never proof of distinctiveness or legal/confusion risk.

Do not label a master `final` until the available production path can reproduce and inspect it.

## Delivery

Return the committed recommendation or artifact, concise rationale where it improves future judgment, applicable verification, and material unresolved truth/authority/reality/craft dependencies. Do not return internal exploration transcripts.
