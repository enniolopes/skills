## H1

Estimand: E1
Primary test: T1
Mode: confirmatory
Generated from: none

### Design
Claim type: associational
Population: municipalities
Exposure: X
Outcome: Y
Contrast: X vs not X
Time: 2026
Identification: associational contrast
Dependence: cluster by region

### Decision rule
CONFIRMED when: T1 interval is entirely below zero
REFUTED when: T1 interval is entirely above zero
INCONCLUSIVE when: T1 interval contains zero

### Assumptions
| ID | Assumption | Check | Failure action |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | regional dependence is handled by planned inference | K1 | BLOCKED |

### Primary analysis
Test: T1
Estimator: difference in means
Inference: cluster-aware interval defined by the plan
Why this estimates E1: it targets the recorded X contrast

### Sensitivity
- S1: report an alternate defensible summary without changing the primary decision

### Specification dimensions
- none

### Interpretation boundary
May claim: association for E1 under the recorded design
May not claim: causal effect
"""

PROTOCOL = """# Protocol

## Question
Does X differ in Y in the target municipalities?

Claim: associational
Unit of analysis: municipality
Estimand: E1, mean Y difference for X=1 versus X=0 in the target municipalities
Refutation: the primary decision rule in analysis-plan.md does not support the predicted direction
Objection: regional dependence
Who cares: programme office
Non-goals: causal effects and mechanisms

## H1
H1 predicts lower Y for X=1. Primary test T1 estimates E1.

## Freeze
Frozen for confirmatory analysis.
