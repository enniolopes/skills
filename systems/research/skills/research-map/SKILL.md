name: research-map
description: Operational memory and mechanical validation across sessions for one research repository. Keeps a small RESEARCH.map pointing to authoritative artifacts, resumes state before work, updates on observable state changes, and composes legacy integrity checks with research 0.8 plan/run/lineage/exposure checks. Normally invoked internally by scientific-method; direct modes remain available for debugging and power users.
when_to_use: Use internally at the start of an existing research session, after gate/hypothesis/registration/corrected-number changes, and before commits or release. Direct triggers include resume, status, validate, update the map, or initialize an existing research.

# Research map

`RESEARCH.map` is the one-screen operational index of a research. It is not a second copy of protocol, analysis plan, results, lineage or history. The repository artifacts remain authoritative; the map says where they are and what state the research is in.

`scientific-method` normally invokes this skill automatically. Do not require the user to perform a session ritual manually.

## Map contract

The grammar and examples live in `reference/map-schema.md`; a blank map is `templates/RESEARCH.map`.

Fixed sections, in order:

| Section | Holds |
|---|---|
| `## Layout` | `protocol`, `decisions`, `aggregates`, `documents`, `notebooks`, `references`; optional disclosure `floor` |
| `## Question` | question pointer; `Problem:` state/brief; `Registration:` state |
| `## Hypotheses` | prediction, refutation, terminal state and pointer; at most three open |
| `## Gates` | one row per phase; state plus evidence for every reached gate |
| `## Facts that were once wrong` | optional correction memory only when no authoritative artifact already communicates it |
| `## Provenance` | optional input pointers not already captured elsewhere |
| `## Verification` | optional repository-specific commands not documented elsewhere |
| `## Open decisions` | optional unresolved decisions not already represented as a blocked gate |
| `## Deferred` | post-freeze ideas not admitted, dated with entry condition |
| `## Last session` | dated state changes and exactly one `Next:` line |

Do not add analysis-plan contents, run manifests or graph edges to the map. `analysis-plan.md` is authoritative for analytic commitment; `.research/runs/` for executions; `research-graph` derives lineage.

## `init`

Build a map from an existing protocol and decision log. Fill only state that belongs in the map. Every gate starts `pending` and becomes `reached` only when the artifact the gate produces exists and the gate row points to it. Finish with `validate`.

## `resume`

Before the first research action in an existing repository, read the map and return one screen in this order: next action; validation failures; gates; problem state; registration; hypotheses/terminal states and open count; blockers; deferred count/nearest entry condition; last recorded change. Then run `validate` before other research work.

A stale map never outranks current executable/source evidence. If map narrative conflicts with current code/data/artifacts, surface the contradiction, use verifiable current evidence and preserve the correction.

## `update`

Update only on observable events: gate state/evidence changed, hypothesis terminal state changed, registration changed, a material number was corrected, or a commit is about to record those changes. Keep `Gates`, `Hypotheses`, `Question` state and `Last session` synchronized with their authoritative artifacts; never copy result prose into the map. Run `validate` after the update.

## `validate`

Run the composed 0.8 validator:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_all.py" RESEARCH.map --offline
```

Legacy checks remain unchanged:

- `map` — schema, pointers, gates/evidence, hypothesis cap, problem-before-protocol and state integrity;
- `numbers` — document/problem-brief numbers are present in committed aggregates at quoted precision (presence, not provenance);
- `decisions` — append-only decision blocks and revision conditions;
- `disclosure` — no count cell below the map floor under documents;
- `citations` — bibliographic resolution; offline is `NOT_VERIFIED`;
- `notebooks` — no committed notebook outputs/execution counts.

0.8 adds:

- `plan` — stable H/E/T IDs, decision rules, assumptions/checks/failure actions, dependence and interpretation boundary;
- `runs` — manifest integrity, result artifacts and confirmatory Git freeze ancestry;
- `lineage` — material claim annotations resolve through inference/result/run and hypothesis-deciding claims use the planned primary test;
- `exposure` — discovery data recorded as generating a hypothesis are not silently reused as independent confirmatory evidence.

A check with nothing to examine reports `NOT_VERIFIED`, never `PASS`. Exit is nonzero on `FAIL`; `--strict` also treats `NOT_VERIFIED` as failure.

Use `--only` to isolate checks, for example:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_all.py" RESEARCH.map --offline --only plan,runs,lineage,exposure
```

Mechanical `PASS` means only that those invariants passed. It never means the design, method or claim is scientifically true.

## Boundaries

A number belongs in an aggregate; a scientific commitment in protocol/analysis plan; a methodological choice in the decision log; an execution in a run manifest; a claim in the manuscript; relations in the derived graph. The map points and navigates. It does not absorb those roles.
