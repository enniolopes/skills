# Epistemic preflights

Phases describe where the research is. Preflights govern the action about to happen. Run the smallest applicable preflight before the action, regardless of phase.

## FIT

Before a confirmatory analysis can expose its result, require:

- hypothesis and estimand IDs;
- one recorded primary test;
- an `analysis-plan.md` block with assumptions, checks, failure actions, dependence and interpretation boundary;
- protocol and analysis-plan freezes that predate the run;
- registration/DRY_RUN state consistent with the protocol;
- data exposure compatible with confirmatory use;
- a run role: `primary | sensitivity | specification | diagnostic`.

A `primary` confirmatory run executes the frozen primary test and may decide the hypothesis under the frozen decision rule. A confirmatory sensitivity/specification/diagnostic run must have its T<n> named in the frozen plan and may qualify/check the primary result, never replace it as the deciding test.

The execution commit recorded by the run must contain the identified input paths and result artifact. Rewriting an old aggregate under the same R<n> after that commit is artifact drift, not an update; create a new run/result identity or restore the committed artifact.

A missing material condition blocks the fit. Do not satisfy a failed preflight with an explanation of what the missing artifact probably would have contained.

## CHANGE_PLAN

A post-freeze change is classified before editing the confirmatory plan:

- `SPECIFICATION` when it is a defensible alternative that preserves the same estimand **and was already admitted prospectively in the frozen plan**;
- `EXPLORATORY` when it is result-driven or hypothesis-generating;
- `DEFERRED` when it does not enter the current research;
- `REOPEN` when it changes the confirmatory scientific commitment. `REOPEN` requires a logged decision and a new freeze.

Classification is not complete when it exists only in the conversation. Before returning from the preflight, make the destination durable in the artifact that owns it:

- `SPECIFICATION` — reference the already-frozen T<n>/dimension; if executed, its run manifest uses `analysis_role: specification`;
- `EXPLORATORY` — if executed, record an exploratory run manifest; if retained but not executed, place it in `RESEARCH.map` `Deferred` as an exploratory candidate with its entry condition;
- `DEFERRED` — write it to `RESEARCH.map` `Deferred` with the condition that would admit/revisit it;
- `REOPEN` — append a methodological decision and create new protocol/analysis-plan freezes before subsequent confirmatory work.

A genuinely new post-freeze alternative cannot be relabeled `SPECIFICATION` to keep confirmatory status. A previous run remains judged against the plan commit frozen for that run. A reopen governs subsequent work; it does not rewrite historical provenance.

Silent rewrite and verbal-only routing are not states.

## CLAIM

Before a material claim enters prose, require an executed result, a valid run, the relevant planned test and checks, an interpretation boundary that permits the wording, and no unresolved supersession or material contradictory result. Give the claim a stable ID and lineage annotation.

A hypothesis-deciding claim must come from a confirmatory `primary` run executing that run's frozen primary test. Sensitivity, specification, diagnostic and exploratory results may support/qualify claims but do not decide the confirmatory hypothesis.

## CITE

A source may suggest a search while merely discovered. It supports a scientific or methodological proposition only after the relevant source content has been retrieved and read. DOI/URL resolution proves identity/reachability, not semantic support.

## PUBLISH

Before release, require material claims to have complete lineage and an independent adversarial review; no unresolved `FAIL`; material `NOT_VERIFIED` explicitly disclosed or resolved; reporting/disclosure requirements satisfied; and human-owned publication/ethics decisions present.

Independent review is evidenced by a durable `.research/reviews/REVIEW-<n>.md` record containing the reviewed repository commit, manuscript path and the returned reviewer verdict/findings. The record is written from an actual separate reviewer invocation (`research:reviewer-2` when available), not from the orchestrator reviewing its own work inline. If the independent reviewer capability cannot run, the review requirement is `NOT_VERIFIED`; do not simulate independence. A review record that predates material manuscript/result changes is stale and does not satisfy PUBLISH until the affected review is rerun.

## Forbidden transitions

The following transitions are invalid:

```text
RESULT_SEEN -> RETROACTIVE_FALLBACK
DISCOVERY_DATA -> INDEPENDENT_CONFIRMATION_OF_DERIVED_HYPOTHESIS
SOURCE_DISCOVERED -> SUPPORTS_CLAIM
UNEXECUTED_NUMBER -> RESULT
SECONDARY_TEST -> DECIDES_HYPOTHESIS_AGAINST_PRIMARY
FROZEN_PROTOCOL -> SILENT_REWRITE
VERBAL_CHANGE_CLASSIFICATION -> COMPLETED_CHANGE_PLAN
INLINE_SELF_REVIEW -> INDEPENDENT_REVIEW
VALIDATOR_PASS -> SCIENTIFICALLY_TRUE
```

Route invalid transitions to a legitimate state: prospective fallback, `EXPLORATORY`, `DEFERRED`, `REOPEN`, `BLOCKED` or `NOT_VERIFIED`.
