# Phase 4 — Data

Verified 2026-09-10 (sources located, not yet read at source).

**When this applies.** Whenever an input enters the repository, two sources are joined, a
population is defined, or an aggregate leaves the analysis environment.

**What it requires.**

- **Provenance file per input**: origin, date of access, version or hash, licence, the
  notebook that reads it. Nothing is read from a path without a provenance entry.
- **Stable key** for every reconciliation between sources; where none exists, the matching
  rule is written down and its error measured.
- **Linkage table per step** (GUILD): records in, records matched, unmatched by reason,
  duplicates, and the expected effect of linkage error on results.
- **Population definitions** stated for every pool ("registered" includes or excludes
  withdrawn units?); each defensible alternative becomes a specification-curve dimension
  (origin case F6).
- **Construct validation** for any modelled or proxy measure adopted from outside, with a
  switch rule: what result would make you drop it (F7).
- **Disclosure floor.** Any aggregate that leaves the analysis environment respects the
  minimum cell size the repository sets; PII is dropped at the first step, and no
  identifiable row exists outside the cache.
- **Datasheet** for any dataset the research publishes: motivation, composition,
  collection, preprocessing, uses, distribution, maintenance.

**The error it prevents.** A pool that silently includes units it should not; a proxy
adopted without knowing what it measures; a count that cannot be traced to a file; a
published table that identifies a household.

**Exit gate.** Linkage report exists for every join; provenance exists for every input;
population definitions and their alternatives are in the protocol; no identifiable row
outside the cache.
