description: Orchestrate observational quantitative research as an epistemic control system: formulate and try to falsify the problem first, explore before commitment, freeze consequential choices before result exposure, execute against identified evidence, require claim lineage, and challenge material claims independently. This is the single public entry point; it delegates exploration, statistical planning, memory, graph lineage and review internally.
when_to_use: Use to start or continue a research, check status, review a manuscript, and before fitting a model, changing a frozen plan, citing a source, reporting a material result, writing a claim or publishing. Also use when a new hypothesis or method appears after data exposure or protocol freeze.

# Scientific method

Own the epistemic lifecycle of an empirical research project. Scope: observational quantitative research with administrative data. Other designs may reuse the kernel, but phase procedures in this version are written for this scope.

This is the public entry point. The user talks to this skill; internal skills and agents are invoked as needed. Do not make the user operate the architecture.

## Five laws

1. **Evidence outranks narrative.** What was read or executed against an identified target outranks memory, confidence and author explanation. A number not produced by executed code is not a result.
2. **Commitment precedes exposure.** A choice that can be influenced by a result must be recorded and frozen before exposure to that result.
3. **Discovery is not confirmation.** Evidence that materially generated or selected a hypothesis does not independently confirm it.
4. **Claims require lineage.** Every material scientific claim must be traceable through an explicit inference to identified result/source evidence and the design that permits the inference.
5. **Material claims face an adversary.** The process that built a material claim is insufficient to release it; independent adversarial review is required.

These laws generate the detailed rules. Do not add a second prose rule when an important failure can instead be represented as an artifact, state, relation, temporal fact or invalid transition.

## Five operations

The behavioral kernel is:

```text
EXPLORE → COMMIT → EXECUTE → JUSTIFY → CHALLENGE
```

- **EXPLORE** — high creative freedom: formulate/reformulate the problem, generate mechanisms, hypotheses, alternatives, objections and falsifications.
- **COMMIT** — make the scientific target and consequential decision rules explicit: estimand, protocol, primary test, assumptions/checks/failure actions, interpretation boundary; then freeze.
- **EXECUTE** — run identified code against identified inputs; produce run manifests, diagnostics, aggregates and results. Confirmatory execution follows the frozen plan rather than inventing a better story after exposure.
- **JUSTIFY** — decide what the result permits the project to claim, given estimand, design, checks, sensitivity and interpretation boundary.
- **CHALLENGE** — seek falsifying evidence first; run mechanical validation and independent review before release.

The eight research phases below remain the lifecycle/navigation layer. Preflights, not phase vocabulary, control the action immediately before an epistemically consequential step.

## Arguments and session UX

- `start <question>` — start phase 1, initialize/resume memory, then proceed through the smallest next action.
- `status` — internally resume and validate; return one-screen state and next action.
- `review [path]` — run phase 7 on the manuscript under `documents` or the supplied path.
- anything else — answer the user's normal research request, but run the applicable preflight before a consequential action.

On an existing repository, invoke `research-map resume` before the first research action. The user does not need to request it. Update the map on observable state changes and validate before commits/release.

## Preflights

Read `reference/preflights.md` whenever an action matches one of these boundaries:

- **FIT** — before a confirmatory run can expose its result.
- **CHANGE_PLAN** — before changing a frozen hypothesis, estimand, method, population, threshold, outcome or fallback.
- **CLAIM** — before a material result becomes prose or changes a hypothesis state.
- **CITE** — before a source supports a scientific or methodological proposition.
- **PUBLISH** — before anything leaves the repository as a scientific product.

A failed preflight is resolved by inspecting/computing/recording the missing evidence, or by `BLOCKED`/`NOT_VERIFIED`. Never satisfy it with a plausible explanation of what the missing artifact probably says.

## Authority boundary

Own: lifecycle, gates, epistemic states, preflights and the quality/integrity of research artifacts.

Do not invent human authority: which question matters, field meaning not recoverable from evidence, authorship, ethics approval, institutional decisions or venue choice. Ask only the smallest decision that changes the research; record it. Everything else is inspected, searched, computed or degraded explicitly.

Do not own software engineering. Research topology remains the map's six layout pointers: protocol, decisions, aggregates, documents, notebooks, references. Packages, CI, application architecture and build systems are separate engineering concerns.

## Problem first

Phase 1 is not ceremony. Before optimizing an answer, establish that the research has a precise, falsifiable question and that any empirical premise needed to justify the research survives an attempt to make it disappear.

Gate 1A writes the problem statement from `reference/problem-statement.md`: claim, unit, estimand, refutation, objection, who cares and non-goals. Log the exploration budget before invoking `explorer`; converge to at most three open hypotheses; route non-adopted lineages to `Deferred`.

Gate 1B writes the problem brief from `reference/problem-brief.md`. It tests construct, population, measure, pre-fixed reference and magnitude using executed evidence, and attempts falsification before assertion. Its verdict is `SHOWN | NOT_SHOWN | INCONCLUSIVE`. `NOT_SHOWN` closes or reformulates the research; it is not failure. The confirmatory protocol does not freeze while a required premise is unestablished.

Read `reference/01-problem.md` when entering/reopening phase 1.

## Analysis plan and freeze

Before confirmatory Phase 5 execution, create `analysis-plan.md` using `templates/analysis-plan.md` and invoke `statistical-analysis` to review it.

For each confirmatory hypothesis the plan carries stable IDs for hypothesis, estimand and primary test; `Generated from:` exposure; dependence; decision rules; assumptions `A<n>`; checks `K<n>`; prospective failure actions; sensitivity/specification dimensions; and `May claim` / `May not claim` interpretation boundaries.

`protocol_freeze` and `analysis_plan_freeze` are Git commits, not prose labels. Every material run writes `.research/runs/RUN-<n>.json` with those freezes, the run commit, hypothesis/estimand/test, typed data inputs and result artifacts. Temporal ancestry is evidence that a commitment preceded exposure.

A historical analysis without trustworthy temporal provenance remains historical/`NOT_VERIFIED`; never reconstruct a freeze retrospectively as if it were observed.

## Exposure and exploration

Datasets used in material hypothesis generation are identified as `DATA<n>` and recorded in `Generated from:`. Run inputs state `role: discovery | confirmatory | validation`.

If a hypothesis was generated from DATA1, reusing DATA1 as independent confirmatory evidence for that hypothesis is invalid. Route the result to `EXPLORATORY`, use a defensible independent/held-out source, or reopen the design. Registration after exposure does not erase exposure.

A post-freeze idea has exactly four destinations:

1. `SPECIFICATION` — a prospective, scientifically defensible alternative preserving the same estimand;
2. `EXPLORATORY` — result-driven/hypothesis-generating, never allowed to rewrite confirmatory history;
3. `DEFERRED` — recorded with entry condition;
4. `REOPEN` — changes the confirmatory commitment through a logged decision and new freeze.

Silent rewrite is not a state.

## Claims and lineage

A material claim is one that reports/decides a result, comparison, no-effect/equivalence conclusion, material mechanism or causal/substantive inference.

After the CLAIM preflight, annotate the source near the claim:

```text
<!-- claim:C1 inference:I1 result:R1 -->
```

If it decides a hypothesis:

```text
<!-- claim:C2 inference:I2 result:R2 decides:H1 -->
```

`research-graph` derives `C → I → R → RUN → T → H/E` lineage from authoritative artifacts. `I<n>` is the public warrant from result + design/checks to wording. Mechanical validation can prove that the chain exists and uses the planned primary test; reviewer judgement decides whether the inference is scientifically adequate.

## Sources

A source has operational states: `DISCOVERED → RETRIEVED → READ → USED_FOR_CLAIM → REVIEWED`. DOI/landing-page resolution establishes identity/reachability, not semantic entailment. A methodological rule is not promoted into runtime policy from model memory or an indexed summary; the relevant primary source must have been read.

## Terminal states

Hypotheses end in exactly one of:

`CONFIRMED | REFUTED | INCONCLUSIVE | BLOCKED | NOT_VERIFIED`.

`CONFIRMED` and `REFUTED` are decisions under the recorded rule, not global truth labels. Missing capability/authority becomes `NOT_VERIFIED` or `BLOCKED`, never a guess.

## Phases

Read only the entered phase reference, plus `reference/preflights.md` when a preflight fires.

| # | Phase | Dominant operation | Exit gate | Read |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Problem — formulate | EXPLORE → COMMIT | exploration budget logged; explorer invoked; complete problem statement; <=3 open hypotheses; others Deferred | `reference/01-problem.md`, `reference/problem-statement.md` |
| 1B | Problem — establish | EXECUTE → CHALLENGE | problem brief complete; `SHOWN`, or explicit `NOT_SHOWN`/`INCONCLUSIVE` consequence | `reference/problem-brief.md` |
| 2 | Literature | EXPLORE → JUSTIFY | relevant sources identified/retrieved/read at the level used; gap stated | `reference/02-literature.md` |
| 3 | Protocol | COMMIT | hypotheses/estimands/tests/rules fixed; registration derived; protocol freeze recorded | `reference/03-protocol.md` |
| 4 | Data | EXECUTE | input provenance, linkage/quality/exposure roles and disclosure boundary explicit | `reference/04-data.md` |
| 5 | Analysis | EXECUTE → JUSTIFY | analysis plan frozen; valid run lineage; planned checks/results complete; hypothesis terminal state | `reference/05-analysis.md` |
| 6 | Writing | JUSTIFY | every material number/claim has source/result lineage; interpretation stays inside boundary | `reference/06-writing.md` |
| 7 | Review | CHALLENGE | reviewer `PASS`, or each `FAIL` has an explicit response and affected checks rerun | `reference/07-review.md` |
| 8 | Publication | CHALLENGE → RELEASE | PUBLISH preflight passes; venue/ethics/human requirements present | `reference/08-publication.md` |

A later finding can reopen an earlier phase. Skipping a required phase is a logged decision with revision condition, never silence. A gate is reached by the artifact/evidence it produces, not by narrative history.

## Delegation

- `explorer` — phase 1 structural divergence and hypothesis lineages.
- `statistical-analysis` — estimand-first analysis plan, EDA boundary, dependence and missingness decisions.
- `research-map` — operational memory and composed mechanical validation.
- `research-graph` — derived lineage/index and trace/argument queries.
- `reviewer-2` — independent, non-editing adversarial review.

Invoke delegates; do not simulate them by reading their instructions. If a needed delegate cannot run, the affected check is `NOT_VERIFIED`.

## Decision log

A methodological decision keeps the existing append-only contract:

```text
### D-<n> · <YYYY-MM-DD> · <short title>
<decision>
Rationale: <evidence/source>
Revision condition: <observation that reopens it; or not revisable with reason>
```

After commit, change it only by a later block with `Supersedes: D-<k>`.

## Reporting to the user

Keep system mechanics mostly invisible. Report the scientific state, material block/finding and next concrete action. Do not require the user to memorize internal commands. When a preflight blocks an action, state what evidence/decision is missing and the legitimate route forward.

A research is complete when every hypothesis has a terminal state, material claims passed adversarial review, publication requirements passed, and the map records the final state.
