Research system for Claude Code. It keeps empirical research problem-first, prospective, traceable, and independently reviewed.

Scope: observational quantitative research, especially administrative data.

## Quick start

Run Claude Code from the root of a **Git repository** for the research project. Git history is used to prove that confirmatory commitments existed before result exposure.

Install once:

```text
/plugin marketplace add enniolopes/skills
/plugin install research@enniolopes
/plugin install explorer@enniolopes
```

Start a new research project:

```text
/research:scientific-method start <idea or question>
```

Then talk normally. For example:

```text
Explore alternative explanations.
Check whether the problem is actually present in the data.
I want to start the analysis.
This result looks strange; investigate it.
Write the results section.
Review the paper before submission.
```

For an existing research repository, invoke:

```text
/research:scientific-method
```

Useful explicit commands:

```text
/research:scientific-method status
/research:scientific-method review [manuscript]
```

You do **not** need to call `research-map`, `statistical-analysis`, `research-graph`, `explorer`, validators, or `reviewer-2` manually. The orchestrator uses them when needed.

## How it works

Research follows five rules:

1. **Problem first.** Formulate the question, explore alternatives, and try to make the empirical premise disappear before committing to expensive analysis.
2. **Commit before exposure.** Confirmatory choices that a result could influence are recorded and frozen before that result is seen.
3. **Evidence over narrative.** Executed code and inspected sources outrank memory, confidence, or explanation.
4. **Discovery is not confirmation.** Data used to generate a hypothesis do not independently confirm it.
5. **Claims need lineage and challenge.** Material claims trace back to evidence and face independent adversarial review before release.

The lifecycle remains:

```text
problem → literature → protocol → data → analysis → writing → review → publication
```

The system handles the gates and preflights internally. If valid work can proceed, it should proceed; if a required condition is missing, it becomes `BLOCKED` or `NOT_VERIFIED` rather than being invented.

## What the system records

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RESEARCH.map` | Current research state and next action |
| `protocol.md` | Scientific question, hypotheses, estimands, and commitments |
| `analysis-plan.md` | Primary tests, assumptions, checks, fallbacks, and interpretation limits |
| `decisions.md` | Methodological decisions and revision conditions |
| `.research/runs/` | What was executed, on which inputs, under which frozen commits |
| `aggregates/` | Computed results |
| `.research/reviews/` | Independent review evidence |
| manuscript | Scientific communication |

The derived research graph is rebuildable and is not a second source of truth.

## What happens at important boundaries

- **Before a confirmatory fit:** the system checks the estimand, primary test, assumptions/checks/failure actions, dependence, freezes, registration, and data exposure.
- **After a frozen-plan change:** the idea must become `SPECIFICATION`, `EXPLORATORY`, `DEFERRED`, or an explicit `REOPEN`; silent rewrites are not allowed.
- **Before a material claim:** the result, run, planned test, checks, and interpretation boundary must support the wording.
- **Before citing a source as evidence:** the relevant source content must have been retrieved and read.
- **Before publication:** material claims need current independent review and no unresolved material failure.

## Research states

The initial problem can end as:

```text
SHOWN | NOT_SHOWN | INCONCLUSIVE
```

Hypotheses end as:

```text
CONFIRMED | REFUTED | INCONCLUSIVE | BLOCKED | NOT_VERIFIED
```

These are decisions under the recorded design and rules, not universal truth labels.

## Validation

The validator checks mechanical properties such as map integrity, prospective plan structure, Git ancestry, run provenance, claim lineage, data exposure, citations, and notebooks.

A validator `PASS` means only that coded invariants passed. It does **not** prove that the scientific design or interpretation is correct.

For debugging/power use:

```text
python3 <installed research-map>/scripts/validate_all.py RESEARCH.map --offline
```

## Explorer

`explorer` is installed separately and is used for structural divergence and hypothesis generation. If it is unavailable, the affected exploration is `NOT_VERIFIED`; the rest of `research` remains usable.

## Development evidence

Behavioral evals live under `development/research/evals/`. The historical 0.7 baseline is diagnostic evidence; claims that 0.8 improves behavior require separate adjudicated control/treatment runs.
