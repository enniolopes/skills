## Claude Code

Add the marketplace once:

```text
/plugin marketplace add enniolopes/skills
```

Install the capability you want:

```text
/plugin install branding-studio@enniolopes
/plugin install landing-page@enniolopes
/plugin install explorer@enniolopes
/plugin install research@enniolopes
```

`research` uses `explorer` for structural exploration, so install both when using the research system:

```text
/plugin install research@enniolopes
/plugin install explorer@enniolopes
```

Then describe the job normally. For Research, see the [Research quick start](systems/research/).

## ChatGPT

For standalone Skills, where Skills are available on your account, upload the skill ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/enniolopes/skills/releases).

Workspace admins can also import this repository as a plugin marketplace from **Workspace settings → Plugins → Add → Import marketplace** using:

```text
https://github.com/enniolopes/skills
```

## Gemini CLI

Standalone Skills can be installed directly from this repository:

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/enniolopes/skills.git --path skills/<name>
```

## Other Agent Skills hosts

Install the chosen `skills/<name>/` directory using the host's normal Agent Skills flow.

Standalone Skills are the most portable unit. `research` is a composed system and currently targets plugin hosts such as Claude Code.
